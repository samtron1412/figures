# figures
All figures are used in docs.

# Why?

- Why don't we store these figures in folders next to the `.md` files?
    + Because it'll be a nightmare to refactor files and contents when we have to move both files and figures.

# How?

- This centralized repository will help with always keep the figures in the same place even with the refactoring of `.md` files.
- The repository is organized as a flat-one-level repo to store all the figures in only one-level deep directories.
- The directory name is unique and can be constructed by appending all parts of the path to the corresponding `.md` file. We might need to modify these directory names sometimes to reflect the refactor in the `.md` files.
